\section{Scraping Data}
I have worked on a project before where I scraped my own data for soccer statistics. I found the site WhoScored.com had the best and most statistics for me to use for the project. Also, being interested in sports data (which is why I am in grad school for sports data analytics), it would be interesting to understand how to scrape data for any sport for future use. 
\\In undergrad, I was a finance major, so any scraping of stock prices and market changes would be interesting as well. 



\section{Question 6 Answers}
4.What is each class?
\\
Class(df):SparkR
\\
Class(df1): data.frame
\\
\\
5.If you try the previous command on df1, what happens? Why do you think
that happened?
\\
An error occurs. Truly I have no idea why it would have occurred. Assuming it has something to do with the different class.

6.If you try the previous command on df1, what happens? Why do you think
that happened?
\\
Another error message occurs. Again I asssume it has to do with one being spark and one being data.frame.
